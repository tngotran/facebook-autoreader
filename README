This is the facebook group manager tools for personal users those can use their facebook account to read info on their account (personal page/group) and filter some keywords and push a message through Messenger as notification

As I remmember this code requires developer mode, and some pre-setting with Messenger. :( I did it quite long time ago :)

branches:
1. master: for continuing searching for specific message and send through messenger
2. group coppyer: coppy content from one group to another, to duplicate groups
3. group manager: search and send message to users with pre-defined contents.
